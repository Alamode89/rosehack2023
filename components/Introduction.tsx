        Rose Hack is UC Riverside&#39;s 24-hour hackathon, one of the few
        women-centric hackathons in California! Founded by the female leaders of
        the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM-W) and the Society of Women
        Engineers (SWE), Rose Hack&#39;s mission is to encourage individuals
        from underrepresented groups in STEM to gain experience, create strong
        networks, and build amazing projects through their shared passions in
        Science and Technology. Rose Hack welcomes both undergraduate and high
        school students for a lively weekend filled with innovation, discovery,
        networking, mentorship, and so much more!
